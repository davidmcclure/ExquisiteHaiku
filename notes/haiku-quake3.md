On and off for about two years, back between 2011 and 2013, I spent a bunch of time (probably too much time) working on a very strange, very fun side project called Exquisite Haiku. The idea was pretty simple. I wanted to see if I could write a web application that would make it possible for groups of people - 2 people, 200, 2000, whatever - to work together in a real-time, interactive environment to compose short little poems that would emerge, in some kind of organic way, from the collective intelligence of the group. An early version of this idea originally popped into my head back in college, when I was reading a bunch of literary theory and got interested in the theoretical notion of an "authorless" text, which, for various reasons, was a recurring mind game that binds together large swaths of 20th century literary criticism. In the 20s and 30s, the New Critics dispatched with the old, traditional notion of the capital-A-Author, arguing that a piece of literature is a self-contained little system that isn't controlled by anyone else, even the person who created it. In the 60's, Barthes and Foucault proclaimed that the author was "dead," although for different reasons - the author, for a lot of good reasons, became associated patriarchy, hierarchy, and imperialism, a symbol for top-down narratives about truth and meaning. But, then the author had a comeback in the 80's and 90's with the rise of the new historicists and the neo-pragmatists, who basically said - hold on a second, this is getting little crazy, books actually are written by authors who are trying to say things. I don't have a horse in the race, but the whole time I found myself thinking - "Ha! But what if there _actually were_ a text that really, literally, no-joke didn't have an author?" A poem that materialized out of thin air, a piece of language couldn't be traced back to anyone, but still had the functionality of a text that could - the coherence, the specificity of meaning, the sense deliberateness? It's like a literary-critical snow leopard - something everyone talks about, but no one's ever actually seen.

The way to do this, I thought, would be to spread authorship so thin that it turned into something that couldn't really be called authorship - distribute it across lots of people until it's impossible to draw a line from any part of the text back to any individual person. This bounced around in my head for about three years, but by the time I actually started writing code in 2011, my interest had changed a bit.

For about a two-year stretch, back between 2011 and 2013, I spent many hundreds (thousands?) or hours working on a really weird, really fun side project called Exquisite Haiku. The idea was pretty simple. I wanted to see if I could write a web application that would make it possible for groups of people - as few as two, and, in theory, as many as hundreds of even thousands - to work together in some kind of real-time, interactive environment to compose a short little poem that would scramble up and mix together the authorial intentions of all the players into a single little unit of literature. A kind of literary blender,
