# Exquisite Haiku
Experiments with Real-Time, Collaborative Poetry Composition

### The Exquisite Corpse and the "Fold"

First played in the early 1920's at rue Fontaine #42 in Paris, the "Exquisite Corpse" was one of the earliest and most influential of the Surrealist parlor games. A group of people sit around a table and pass around a piece of paper - each player writes or sketches a new bit of content onto the page, and then folds the paper so that the next person can only see small portion of composite image closest to the next space to be filled in. The end result is a blocky, phantasmagorical mash-up of the players' contributions, all highly individuated but bound together by amorphous daisy-chain of associations emerging from each players' patrial but incomplete knowledge of the whole.

For Breton and the Surrealists, this disjointedness was a feature, not a bug - these "chain games" were efforts to invent alterntive modes of artistic praxis that moved away from what was considered to be the rigid, stifling intentionalism and closure of conventional, single-author works and towards a collaborative, almost ritualistic communion with the _sur_ (super) reality of Freudian free-association. The "links" of the chain _need_ to be blocky, rough, and obviously collaborative.




At the same time, there's a sense in which this multiplication of authorship can only go so far before it starts to undo itself. As the final product becomes increasingly fractured and decomposed, as the collaboration becomes increasingly _smooth_, the "collective individuality" of the corpse - defined by the discreteness of its components parts - starts to fade into an increasing granularity or continuousness, like a blocky, pixelated line resolving into a crisp edge at higher resolution, or the pulse of a fluorescent light disappearing into continuousness as the frequency of the oscillation increases.

Laxon describes a variation of the game played by Breton in the mid-1930's that did away with the concealing "folds," instead allowing the players to see the whole of the existing work while they added their contribution. These works were also subjected to a much greater level of post-processing - "corrections" to conceal the discontinuities between the sections, touch-ups on the shading, and other after-the-fact modifications that ironed over the productive dissonance of the original Corpse. This edit to the game mechanic, Laxon argues, has the paradoxical effect of pushing the whole project back towards the compositional unity and "closure of meaning" that the Corpse (and, really, the Surrealist project at large) was trying to escape in the first place. As the collaboration becomes increasingly fluid and scrambled, the work starts to recuperate homogeneity and fall back into the (for the Surrealists, oppressive) unity and intentionality of the single-author work. For Laxon, this is essentially an artistic _error_, at least when help up against the intellectual goals of the movement. The Corpse stakes its claim to originality on the abrupt, lurching experience of moving among individuated, discrete sections in the work; as the sections bleed together the work starts to reassemble towards conceptual unity, and the corpse cedes its _raison d'Ãªtre_.

Of course, none of the actual works produced under Breton's short-lived abolishment of the fold actually get close to this hypothetical end-point - as Laxon observes, even the most polished and "corrected" of the works created during this period are still intensely disjointed by any conventional standard. They were beginning to (re)acquire some of the characteristics of single-author works, but they still bore the obvious mark of multiple hands. In one example from 1931, Laxon can easily trace out one-to-one correspondences between individual players and individual sections of the corpse - the wheel-shaped head belongs to Hugo, the table-like waist to Breton, the horse imagery to Eluard.

But what if this weren't the case? What if the collaboration were _so_ granular, so completely pulverized, that it would be _ontologically_ impossible to point to any addressable section of the work and connect it to an individual author? Could this movement towards a kind of final, smooth, unified heterogeneity actually be completed or realized? Would it really be possible to create a work that looks, acts, and _behaves_ exactly like a single-author work, even while factually emerging from some kind of radically collaborative process completely alien to individual artistic production? From a different standpoint (admittedly, one largely indifferent to the Surrealist agenda, and at times even at odds with it) there's something intriguing and theoretically fraught about this proposition of a kind of _total_ or _complete_ granularization of a collaborative process that homes back in the direction of artistic unity.

Far from being a drab return to the status quo, such a text would be highly exotic from a theoretical standpoint. If the text is really, factually _unattributable_ - if it's actually impossible to trace anything in the text back to any individual mind - then who (or what) is the author? Does it have authorS, as a conventional Corpse clearly does? But if it appears to present a relatively unified meaning, as if it had _an_ author, what kind of hermeneutical model can map a one-to-many association between the text and the plural authors? Should the entire text just be attributed to all of them? But that seems reductive - is that really different from just saying that there is _an_ author, which there clearly isn't? Does it actually constitute language, or does it just _resemble_ language, like some kind of random, found structure that incidentally forms word tokens (Knapp, Michaels). Or maybe a text with "sentence meaning" but no "speaker meaning" (Searle)? But doesn't that steamroll over the fact that the text was causally created by real, volitional actions by real human agents. What is it?

Instead of asking whether collaboration can be used to _destroy_ single-author rationalism and intention (answered in the affirmative with the _cadavre exquis_), Breton's short-lived modification to the rules provokes the opposite question - can collaboration be used to _create_ single-author rationalism? Is it possible for people to speak, intend, and _mean_ in unison? 

### Exquisite Haiku and Intentionless Meaning

In an effort to explore this question, I build Exquisite Haiku, a real-time, collaborative web application written in JavaScript on the Node.js framework that makes it possible for groups of people - as few as two, and theoretically as many as about 1000 - to work together in an interactive, synchronous environment to compose three-line English haiku in a standard 5-7-5 syllable pattern. Picking up where Breton's "error" left off, the software attempts to conceptually _complete_ the movement in the direction of increasingly smooth, granular collaboration. Instead of allowing individuals to unilaterally create discretely-addressable sections of the work (folds of the page, sentences, phrases, or even individual words), the register of the collaboration is pushed "down" to _within_ or _below_ the selection of individual words in the text, which are chosen one-by-one by way of an extended consensus-forming process that is designed to completely scramble the individual artistic intentionalities of the players without ever resorting to any kind of randomness or non-determinism.

The words are selected one-by-one in a series of consecutive "word rounds" that are allotted a constant amount of time at the beginning of the poem. At the end of each word round, the word that emerges with the most "points" after an interactive voting and visual conversation process is locked into the next position in the haiku, and the process starts again for the next word. At the start of each word round, players are presented with three key pieces of information - the words that have already been locked in the poem (which, unless the player arrives late, she would have just participated in selecting), a count-down timer showing the amount of time left in the round, and a points counter, showing the number of points available to be allocated to words (this is also a constant number, the same for each round, set at the start). The player can submit "proposals" by typing into a blank input box at the top of the screen and pressing Enter. The software checks to see if the word fits into the syllable pattern of the poem in its current state, and, if so, pushes the new word onto a main, vertical stack called the "ranking stack" that is continuously updated to reflect the current ordering of all the words in terms of total "score."

Starting immediately, and continuing as more word proposals are submitted and the stack grows in size, each player can start to exert influence over the order of the ranking stack by applying positive or negative votes, of arbitrary size, onto individual words. These votes are executed by clicking on a word, dragging the cursor up or down on the page, and pressing the Spacebar to commit the vote. The value of the vote is determined by the radial distance, in pixels, from the original click that initiated the vote (this value is displayed in real-time next to the cursor as it moves on the page). There's no limit to how small or large any individual vote can be, but the sum of a player's votes (in terms of absolute value, with negative votes "costing" as much as positive votes) can never exceed the total value of the player's point account, which is reset at the start of each word round.

Each vote plays out _over time_ - instead of just lumping the entire value of the vote onto the total score of the word all at once, possibly causing an immediate reordering of the stack if the word falls above or below one of its neighbors, the value of the vote is gradually layered onto the word over the course of 30-40 seconds in accordance with an exponential decay curve recomputed every 300 milliseconds by the server. As the vote "plays out," the physical size of the word in the stack dilates to visually communicate the effect of the vote to the rest of the players - large at first, and then increasingly small as the vote dissipates. This scaling effect is cumulative for all the votes on a word at any given point - if a word has multiple positive votes, it will grow even larger in proportion to the total instantaneous value of the votes, and concurrent negative votes will push down the size.

Meanwhile, each vote is also reflected in real-time in a second stack called the "log stack" that is rendered to the left of the main "ranking stack." While the growing and contracting sizes of the words in the ranking stack reflect the aggregate effects of the currently-active votes on the words, the log stack just provides a running, ticker-tape feed of each individual voting action - for each vote, the log stack is updated with a new entry showing the word that was voted on and the numerical quantity of the vote. In addition to providing a kind of "comprehensive" data feed about all the activity in the game, the log stack introduces a second way to apply votes: Players can "re-vote" any of the votes in the log stack by just clicking on the listing - this generates an exact replica of the vote under the player's name, this time deducting points from the account of the player who triggers the re-vote. This encourages a kind of "cascading" or "snowballing" dynamic in the game that increases the volatility and churn of the ranking stack - players will often latch on to a vote that they agree with by re-voting it multiple times, causing a sudden flood of points to the word that push it dramatically up or down.

The interface is shifting, growing, contracting, scrolling tableau of floating words that communicates a constant flow of real-time information about the positive and negative opinions of all the other players about all of the words. This improvisational, ludic process makes it possible to conduct a visually-enacted _conversation_ or _deliberation_ about the words, a kind of hashing-out and collective evaluation of the possibilities in which the agency of each individual is normalized and constrained by the equal distribution of points at the start of each round. The software, in other words, amounts to a kind of microscopic literary democracy for word selection, a set of procedures designed to marshal the disparate opinions and energies of the group into a single, most fair, most representative, most worthy course of action.

### Intentional Intentionlessness


These texts have the interesting quality of being _unattributable_, at least in the conventional sense of the word.


the game manages to peel away the fact of authorship while still retaining all of the important functional characteristics that we use to describe (and even define) authorship and intention - the possibility for unified speaker meaning and intention, the ability to formulate specific, internally consistent expressions about the world.
