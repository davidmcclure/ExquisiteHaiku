And yet this movement from the homogeneity of the single-author work into the heterogeneity of the Corpse, as Susan Laxon observes, seems to contain within itself the seeds of its own undoing when pushed too far. As the final product becomes increasingly fractured and decomposed, as the collaboration becomes increasingly _smooth_, the "collective individuality" of the corpse - defined by the discreteness of its components parts - starts to fade into an increasing granularity or continuousness, like a blocky, pixelated line resolving into a crisp edge at higher resolution, or the pulse of a fluorescent light fading into continuousness as the frequency of the oscillation increases. Laxon describes a variation of the Exquiste Corpse rule set played by Breton in the mid 1930's that did away with the concealing "folds," instead allowing the players to see the whole of the existing work while they added their contribution. These works were also subjected to a much greater level of post-processing - "corrections" to concel the discontinuities between the sections, touch-ups on the shading,  and other after-the-fact modifications that seemed to have the effect of ironing over the disjointed mode of production. This modification to the Exquisite Corpse algorithm, Laxon argues, has the paraoxical effect of circling the whole project back towards the compositional unity and "closure of meaning" that the Corpse (and, really, Surrealism at large) was trying to escape in the first place.

For Laxon, this essentially amounts to an artistic _error_ in the context of the Surrealist project. The increasing continuity of the work undercuts the Surrealist claim to originality, which inheres in the abrupt, non-rational lurching between the juxtaposed sections. 

_Smoothing_ the Corpse into a higher level of cohesion or "quality" 


As Laxon notes, even the most polished and coherent of the works produced under this variation of the rule set were still intensely disjointed by any conventional standard. They were beginning to (re)acquire some of the characteristics of single-author works, but they still bore the tell-tale clumpiness of multiple hands - in one example from 1931, Laxon can easily trace one-to-one correspondences between individual players and the individual sections of the corpse - the wheel-shaped head belongs to Hugo, the table-like waist to Breton, the horse imagery to Eluard.
