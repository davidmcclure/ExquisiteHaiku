### Introduction: The Exquisite Corpse and the "Fold"

And yet this multiplication of authorship, the movement into heterogeneity, as Susan Laxon observes, can only go so far before it starts to undo itself. As the final product becomes increasingly fractured and decomposed, as the collaboration becomes increasingly _smooth_, the "collective individuality" of the corpse - defined by the discreteness of its components parts - starts to fade into an increasing granularity or continuousness, like a blocky, pixelated line resolving into a crisp edge at higher resolution, or the pulse of a fluorescent light disappearing into continuousness as the frequency of the oscillation increases.

Laxon describes a variation of the game played by Breton in the mid-1930's that did away with the concealing "folds," instead allowing the players to see the whole of the existing work while they added their contribution. These works were also subjected to a much greater level of post-processing - "corrections" to conceal the discontinuities between the sections, touch-ups on the shading, and other after-the-fact modifications that ironed over the productive dissonance of the original Corpse. This edit to the game mechanic, Laxon argues, has the paraoxical effect of pushing the whole project back towards the compositional unity and "closure of meaning" that the Corpse (and, really, the Surrealist project at large) was trying to escape in the first place. As the collaboration becomes increasingly fluid and scrambled, the work starts to recuperate homogeneity and fall back into the (for the Surrealists, oppressive) unity and intentionality of the single-author work. For Laxon, this is essentially an artistic _error_, at least when help up against the intellectual goals of the movement. The Corpse stakes its claim to originality on the abrupt, lurching experience of moving among individuated, discrete sections in the work; the sections bleed together, the work starts to reassemble towards conceptual unity, and the corpse cedes its _raison d'Ãªtre_.

Of course, none of the actual works produced under Breton's short-lived abolishment of the fold actually get close to this hypothetical end-point - as Laxon observes, even the most polished and "corrected" of the works created during this period are still intensely disjointed by any conventional standard. They were beginning to (re)acquire some of the characteristics of single-author works, but they still bore the obvious mark of multiple hands. In one example from 1931, Laxon can easily trace out one-to-one correspondences between individual players and individual sections of the corpse - the wheel-shaped head belongs to Hugo, the table-like waist to Breton, the horse imagery to Eluard.

But what if this weren't the case? What if the collaboration were _so_ granular, so completely pulverized, that it would be _ontologically_ impossible to point to any addressable section of the work and connect it to an individual author? What if this movement towards a kind of final heterogeneity could actually be _completed_ or _realized_? Would it really be possible for a work to look, act, and _behave_ exactly like a single-author work, even while factually emerging from some kind of radically collaborative process completely alien to individual artistic production? From a different standpoint - admittedly, one largely indifferent to, and at time even in conflict with, the concerns of the Surrealist agenda - there's something intriguing and theoretically fraught about this vision of a kind of total intensification of a collaborative process that circles back in the direction of artistic unity. Far from being a drab return to the status quo, this text would be highly exotic from a theoretical standpoint - if it is _factually_ unattributable, if no part of it can be defensibly attributed to anyone at all, what effects does it produce when passed through existing interpretive strategies organized around either invoking or (more common) ignoring the factual existence of an author? Does it even constitute language?

Really, Breton's error (no doubt unintentionally) provokes a question that almost exactly inverts the Surrealist interest in collaboration. Instead of asking whether collaboration can be used to _destroy_ single-author rationalism and intention (the _cadavre exquis_), the abolition of the fold and the creeping return of unity make us wonder if collaboration can be used to _create_ single-author rationalism and intention in the strict, full-throated sense of the ideas. More broadly: Is it possible for people to act, speak, intend, and _mean_ in unison?

### Exquisite Haiku and Intentionless Meaning

In an effort to answer this question, I build Exquiste Haiku, a real-time, collaborative web application written in JavaScript (on top of the Node.js framework) that makes it possible for groups of people - as few as two, and theoretically as many as about 1000) to work together in an interactive, synchronous environment to compose three-line English haiku in a standard 5-7-5 syllable pattern. The software attempts to implement a kind of total smoothing and granularization of collaboration in the original Exquiste Corpse game mechanic. The register of the collaboration is pushed "down" from the level of discretely-addresable sections (folds of the page, sentences, phrases, and even individual words) to _within_ or _below_ the selection of the individual words in the text, which are chosen sequentially by way of an extended consensus-forming process that is designed to completely scramble the individual artistic intentionalities of the players without ever resorting any kind of randomness or non-determinism.

The words are selected one-by-one in a series of consecutive "word rounds" that are allotted a constant amount of time at the beginning of the poem. At the end of each word round, the word that emerges with the most "points" after an interactive voting and visual conversation process is locked into the next position in the haiku, and the process starts again for the next word. At the start of each word round, players are presented with three key pieces of information - the words that have already been locked in the poem (which, unless the player arrives late, she would have just participated in selecting), a count-down timer showing the amount of time left in the round, and a points counter, showing the number of points available to be allocated to words (this is also a constant number, the same for each round, set at the start). The player can submit "proposals" by typing into a blank input box at the top of the screen and pressing Enter. The software checks to see if the word fits into the syllable pattern of the poem in its current state, and, if so, pushes the new word onto a main, vertical stack called the "ranking stack" that is continuously updated every 300 milliseconds to reflect the current ordering of all the words in terms of total "score."

Starting immediately, and continuing as more word proposals are submitted and the stack grows in size, each player can start to influence the order of the ranking stack by applying positive or negative votes, of arbitrary size, onto individual words. These votes are executed by clicking on a word, dragging the cursor up or down on the page, and pressing the Spacebar to commit the vote. The value of the vote is determined by the radial distance, in pixels, from the original click that initiated the vote (this value is displayed in real-time next to the cursor as it moves on the page). There's no limit to how small or large any individual vote can be, but the sum of a player's votes (in terms of absolute value, with negative votes "costing" as much as positive votes) can never exceed the total value of the player's point account, which is reset at the start of each word round.
