And yet this movement from the homogeneity of the single-author work into the heterogeneity of the Corpse, as Susan Laxon observes, seems to contain within itself the seeds of its own undoing when pushed too far. As the final product becomes increasingly fractured and decomposed, as the collaboration becomes increasingly _smooth_, the "collective individuality" of the corpse - defined by the discreteness of its components parts - starts to fade into an increasing granularity or continuousness, like a blocky, pixelated line resolving into a crisp edge at higher resolution, or the pulse of a fluorescent light disappearing into continuousness as the frequency of the oscillation increases.

Laxon describes a variation of the game played by Breton in the mid-1930's that did away with the concealing "folds," instead allowing the players to see the whole of the existing work while they added their contribution. These works were also subjected to a much greater level of post-processing - "corrections" to conceal the discontinuities between the sections, touch-ups on the shading, and other after-the-fact modifications that ironed over the productive dissonance of the original Corpse. This edit to the game mechanic, Laxon argues, has the paraoxical effect of pushing the whole project back towards the compositional unity and "closure of meaning" that the Corpse (and, really, the Surrealist project at large) was trying to escape in the first place. As the collaboration becomes increasingly fluid and scrambled, the work starts to recuperate homogeneity and fall back into the (for the Surrealists, oppressive) unity and intentionality of the single-author work. For Laxon, this is essentially an artistic _error_, at least when considered from inside the intellectual tactics of the movement. The Corpse stakes its claim to originality on the abrupt, lurching experience of moving among individuated, discrete sections in the work; the sections bleed together, the work starts to reassemble towards conceptual unity, and the corpse cedes its _raison d'Ãªtre_.

Of course, none of the actual works produced under Breton's short-lived abolishment of the fold actually get close to this hypothetical end-point - as Laxon observes, even the most polished and "corrected" of the works created during this period are still intensely disjointed by any conventional standard. They were beginning to (re)acquire some of the characteristics of single-author works, but they still bore the obvious mark of multiple hands. In one example from 1931, Laxon can easily trace out one-to-one correspondences between individual players and individual sections of the corpse - the wheel-shaped head belongs to Hugo, the table-like waist to Breton, the horse imagery to Eluard.

But what if this weren't the case? What if the collaboration were _so_ granular, so completely pulverized, that it would be _ontologically_ impossible to point to any addressable section of the work and connect it to an individual author? What if this movement towards a kind of final heterogeneity could actually be _completed_ or _realized_? Would it really be possible for a work to look, act, and _behave_ exactly like a single-author work, even while factually emerging from some kind of radically collaborative process completely alien to individual artistic production? From a different standpoint - admittedly, one largely indifferent to, and at time even in conflict with, the concerns of the Surrealist agenda - there's something intriguing and theoretically fraught about this vision of a kind of total intensification of a collaborative process that circles back in the direction of artistic unity. Far from being a drab return to the status quo, this text would be highly exotic from a theoretical standpoint - if no part of it can be defensibly attributed to anyone, does it have a factual, biographical, historical author (or even really authorS, in the way that the Corpse clearly does) that can be either reified or ignored in interpretive praxis?

Really, Breton's error (no doubt unintentionally) provokes a question that almost exactly inverts the Surrealist interest in collaboration. Instead of asking whether collaboration can be used to _destroy_ single-author rationalism and intention (the _cadavre exquis_), the abolition of the fold and the creeping return of unity make us wonder if collaboration can be used to _create_ single-author rationalism and intention in the strict, full-throated senses of the terms. Is it actually possible for people to act, speak, and _mean_ in unison?
